### Lighthouse

Lighthouse validation was run on all pages (both mobile and desktop) in order to check accessibility and performance. At first I received the warning *'Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio'* in relation to buttons where I had used the Bootstrap class `btn-info`. After I updated the button styling I received the below scores.
