# FOOROOM

![Project-image]()

Fooroom is a forum site that aims to strike a happy middle ground between the modern format of Reddit and the sleek form and functionality of traditional bulletin board sites from decades past. Ease of use and no distractions make the foundation of this app's design philosophy.

Users can post, discuss, and interact without any unnecessary distractions.

## Deployment

### Heroku
The Application has been deployed from GitHub to Heroku following the steps:

1. Sign in or sign up at heroku.com
2. Create a new app with a unique app name and select your region
3. Click "Create app"
4. Click "Settings" and then "Config Vars", add a key called "PORT" with the value "8000" and (when making an app like this using an external worksheet) add another key with private API credentials in the value area.
5. Add any required buildpacks. This project uses Python and Node.js, with the latter being used for the terminal display and not the program itself.
6. Go to the "Deploy" tab and, under "Deployment method", select "GitHub." 
7. Insert the GitHub repository link or the name of the repository and click "Search" followed by "Connect" to deploy the GitHub repo to Heroku.
8. Next, you must select a branch of the repository for building the project, in this case "main."
9. Click "Deploy Branch" to deploy, or use "Enable Automatic Deploys" to make automatic deployments when the repo is updated.
10. You'll see a message saying “App was successfully deployed” when it's ready, and you click the "View" button to view the deployed project.
